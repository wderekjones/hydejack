Hi, I'm Derek Jones. 

I work on scalable machine learning/deep learning research for drug discovery at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the [ATOM Constortium](https://atomscience.org). 

I graduated from the University of Kentucky in May of 2018 where I earned an M.Sc. in Computer Science with a research focus in Machine Learning/Deep Learning and its applications to Computational Biology and Drug Discovery. I was advised by [Dr. Nathan Jacobs](https://www.cs.uky.edu/~jacobs) (Computer Science) and [Dr. Sally R. Ellingson](http://www.sallyrellingson.com/) (Biomedical Informatics). 

I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at [University of California - San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) in the [Systems Energy Efficiency (SEE) Lab](http://seelab.ucsd.edu/). My PhD work is focused on finding ways in which we can enable the acceleration of molecular simulations by augmenting traditional physics-based modeling with ideas from machine learning and hardware acceleration.
