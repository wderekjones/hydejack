  abstract  =  "Protein kinases generate nearly a thousand different protein products and regulate the majority of cellular pathways and signal transduction. It is therefore not surprising that the deregulation of kinases has been implicated in many disease states. In fact, kinase inhibitors are the largest class of new cancer therapies. Understanding polypharmacology within the full kinome, how drugs interact with many different kinases, would allow for the development of safer and more efficacious cancer therapies. A full understanding of these interactions is not experimentally feasible making highly accurate computational predictions extremely useful and important. This work aims at making a machine learning model useful for investigating the full kinome. We evaluate many feature sets for our model and get better performance over molecular docking with all of them. We demonstrate that you can achieve a nearly 60\% increase in success rate at identifying binding compounds using our model over molecular docking scores.",

The ability to make accurate computational predictions of drug binding would greatly improve the cost-effectiveness and safety of drug discovery and development. This study incorporates ensemble docking, the use of multiple protein conformations extracted from a molecular dynamics trajectory to perform docking calculations, with additional biomedical data sources and machine learning algorithms to improve the prediction of drug binding. We found that we can greatly increase the classification accuracy of an active vs a decoy compound using these methods over docking scores alone. The best results seen here come from having an individual protein conformation that produces binding features that correlate well with the active vs. decoy classification, in which case we achieve over 99\% accuracy. The ability to confidently make accurate predictions on drug binding would allow for computational polypharamacological networks with insights into side-effect prediction, drug-repurposing, and drug efficacy.",

	abstract={We present a new approach to estimate the binding affinity from given three-dimensional poses of protein–ligand complexes. In this scheme, every protein–ligand atom pair makes an additive free-energy contribution. The sum of these pairwise contributions then gives the total binding free energy or the logarithm of the dissociation constant. The pairwise contribution is calculated by a function implemented via a neural network that takes the properties of the two atoms and their distance as input. The pairwise function is trained using a portion of the PDBbind 2018 data set. The model achieves good accuracy for affinity predictions when evaluated with PDBbind 2018 and with the CASF-2016 benchmark, comparing favorably to many scoring functions such as that of AutoDock Vina. The framework here may be extended to incorporate other factors to further improve its accuracy and power.}
