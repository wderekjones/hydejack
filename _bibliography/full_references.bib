  abstract  =  "Protein kinases generate nearly a thousand different protein products and regulate the majority of cellular pathways and signal transduction. It is therefore not surprising that the deregulation of kinases has been implicated in many disease states. In fact, kinase inhibitors are the largest class of new cancer therapies. Understanding polypharmacology within the full kinome, how drugs interact with many different kinases, would allow for the development of safer and more efficacious cancer therapies. A full understanding of these interactions is not experimentally feasible making highly accurate computational predictions extremely useful and important. This work aims at making a machine learning model useful for investigating the full kinome. We evaluate many feature sets for our model and get better performance over molecular docking with all of them. We demonstrate that you can achieve a nearly 60\% increase in success rate at identifying binding compounds using our model over molecular docking scores.",

  abstract  = "Drug discovery is an expensive, lengthy, and sometimes dangerous process. The ability to make accurate computational predictions of drug binding would greatly improve the cost-effectiveness and safety of drug discovery and development. This study incorporates ensemble docking, the use of multiple protein conformations extracted from a molecular dynamics trajectory to perform docking calculations, with additional biomedical data sources and machine learning algorithms to improve the prediction of drug binding. We found that we can greatly increase the classification accuracy of an active vs a decoy compound using these methods over docking scores alone. The best results seen here come from having an individual protein conformation that produces binding features that correlate well with the active vs. decoy classification, in which case we achieve over 99\% accuracy. The ability to confidently make accurate predictions on drug binding would allow for computational polypharamacological networks with insights into side-effect prediction, drug-repurposing, and drug efficacy.",

              hydrophobicity is critical in the drug discovery process. There
              are many heterogeneous chemical environments within a cell and
              entire human body. For example, drugs must be able to cross the
              hydrophobic cellular membrane to reach their intracellular
              targets, and hydrophobicity is an important driving force for
              drug-protein binding. Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD)
              simulations are routinely used to calculate free energies of
              small molecules binding to proteins, crossing lipid membranes,
              and solvation but are computationally expensive. Machine learning
              (ML) and empirical methods are also used throughout drug
              discovery but rely on experimental data, limiting the domain of
              applicability. We present atomistic MD simulations calculating
              15,000 small molecule free energies of transfer from water to
              cyclohexane. This large data set is used to train ML models that

              graph neural network model achieves the highest accuracy,
              followed closely by a 3D-convolutional neural network, and
              shallow learning based on the chemical fingerprint is
              significantly less accurate. A mean absolute error of âˆ¼4 kJ/mol
              compared to the MD calculations was achieved for our best ML
              model. We also show that including data from the MD simulation
              improves the predictions, tests the transferability of each model
              to a diverse set of molecules, and show multitask learning
              improves the predictions. This work provides insight into the
              hydrophobicity of small molecules and ML cheminformatics
              modeling, and our data set will be useful for designing and
