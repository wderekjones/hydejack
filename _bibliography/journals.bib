                   important in drug discovery but remains a challenge even
                   with computationally expensive biophysics-based energy
                   scoring methods and state-of-the-art deep learning
                   approaches. Despite the recent advances in the deep
                   convolutional and graph neural network based approaches, the
                   model performance depends on the input data representation
                   and suffers from distinct limitations. It is natural to
                   combine complementary features and their inference from the
                   individual models for better predictions. We present fusion
                   models to benefit from different feature representations of
                   two neural network models to improve the binding affinity
                   prediction. We demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed
                   approach by performing experiments with the PDBBind 2016
                   dataset and its docking pose complexes. The results show
                   that the proposed approach improves the overall prediction
                   compared to the individual neural network models with
                   greater computational efficiency than related biophysics
                   based energy scoring functions. We also discuss the benefit
                   of the proposed fusion inference with several example
                   complexes. The software is made available as open source at

  abstract = "Accurately predicting small molecule partitioning and
              hydrophobicity is critical in the drug discovery process. There
              are many heterogeneous chemical environments within a cell and
              entire human body. For example, drugs must be able to cross the
              hydrophobic cellular membrane to reach their intracellular
              targets, and hydrophobicity is an important driving force for
              drug-protein binding. Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD)
              simulations are routinely used to calculate free energies of
              small molecules binding to proteins, crossing lipid membranes,
              and solvation but are computationally expensive. Machine learning
              (ML) and empirical methods are also used throughout drug
              discovery but rely on experimental data, limiting the domain of
              applicability. We present atomistic MD simulations calculating
              15,000 small molecule free energies of transfer from water to
              cyclohexane. This large data set is used to train ML models that
              predict the free energies of transfer. We show that a spatial
              graph neural network model achieves the highest accuracy,
              followed closely by a 3D-convolutional neural network, and
              shallow learning based on the chemical fingerprint is
              significantly less accurate. A mean absolute error of âˆ¼4 kJ/mol
              compared to the MD calculations was achieved for our best ML
              model. We also show that including data from the MD simulation
              improves the predictions, tests the transferability of each model
              to a diverse set of molecules, and show multitask learning
              improves the predictions. This work provides insight into the
              hydrophobicity of small molecules and ML cheminformatics
              modeling, and our data set will be useful for designing and
              testing future ML cheminformatics methods.",

              given three-dimensional poses of protein-ligand complexes. In
              this scheme, every protein-ligand atom pair makes an additive
              free-energy contribution. The sum of these pairwise contributions
              then gives the total binding free energy or the logarithm of the
              dissociation constant. The pairwise contribution is calculated by
              a function implemented via a neural network that takes the
              properties of the two atoms and their distance as input. The
              pairwise function is trained using a portion of the PDBbind 2018
              data set. The model achieves good accuracy for affinity
              predictions when evaluated with PDBbind 2018 and with the
              CASF-2016 benchmark, comparing favorably to many scoring
              functions such as that of AutoDock Vina. The framework here may
