  abstract      = "Predicting accurate protein-ligand binding affinity is
                   important in drug discovery but remains a challenge even
                   with computationally expensive biophysics-based energy
                   scoring methods and state-of-the-art deep learning
                   approaches. Despite the recent advances in the deep
                   convolutional and graph neural network based approaches, the
                   model performance depends on the input data representation
                   and suffers from distinct limitations. It is natural to
                   combine complementary features and their inference from the
                   individual models for better predictions. We present fusion
                   models to benefit from different feature representations of
                   two neural network models to improve the binding affinity
                   prediction. We demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed
                   approach by performing experiments with the PDBBind 2016
                   dataset and its docking pose complexes. The results show
                   that the proposed approach improves the overall prediction
                   compared to the individual neural network models with
                   greater computational efficiency than related biophysics
                   based energy scoring functions. We also discuss the benefit
                   of the proposed fusion inference with several example
                   complexes. The software is made available as open source at
